# Nike-Sales-Dashboard
📌**Project Overview**

This project is an end-to-end Business Analytics dashboard built using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to analyze Nike’s sales performance across products, regions, customer segments, sales channels, and discount strategies.
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights that support data-driven decision-making.


🎯 **Business Problem**
Retail companies often focus heavily on revenue but lack clarity on:
* Which products and regions actually drive 'profit'
* Whether discounts increase long-term value or reduce margins
* How sales performance varies across channels and customer segments
Answering these questions using raw data is time-consuming and inefficient.


✅ **Objective**
To build an interactive analytics dashboard that:
* Provides a holistic view of sales and profitability
* Evaluates the impact of discounts on revenue and margins
* Identifies high-performing products, regions, and channels
* Enables stakeholders to make informed business decisions


🧰 **Tech Stack**
* Excel – Initial data cleaning and exploratory analysis
* SQL – Data validation, aggregation, and business queries
* Power BI Desktop – Dashboard development and visualization
* Power Query – Data transformation and standardization
* DAX – KPI calculations and dynamic measures


📂 **Data Source**
* Source: Kaggle (Nike Sales Dataset – simulated retail data)
* Data Includes:
  * Order details and transaction dates
  * Product line, product name, size, and gender category
  * Units sold, MRP, discounts, revenue, and profit
  * Region and sales channel


🔍 **Key KPIs**
* Total Revenue
* Total Profit
* Total Units Sold
* Average Order Value (AOV)
* Profit Margin (%)

📌 **Key Insights**
